# RISC-V Simulator

We have implemented a Python-based RISC-V simulator. 

## Usage
Run the `RISCV_simulator.py` file with the argument of the relative path to the binary file to be simulated.

## Output
- A `result.res` file will be generated in the `simulator` folder, which records the values of the 32 registers.
- The program outputs all executed instructions and the final register values to the console.

Enjoy using our RISC-V simulator!
